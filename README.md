# Python Portfolio Project:
US Medical Insurance costs project

This project was proposed by CodeCademy as part of the final exercise of Python learning, on the way of my Data Science Path.

Feel free to take a look, and to make any comment or suggestion! I am always looking to learn and keep on growing.
